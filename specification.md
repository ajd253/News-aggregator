Two databases:
    1.  Financial information
        * SEC Edgar
        * PitchBook
    2. Media information/coverage
        * Google Custom Search
        * Vendor press release pages
        * Media RSS feeds
            * Finextra
            * Bob's Guide

What do will users be able to ask?
How will we expose functionality to users?
When should we update databases?

Mark's contact at UMontana - runs the information science programme at the university. May be possible to spec the system and send it to him for student's to code.
